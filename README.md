# Hospital Dashboard
This project analyzes hospital data using patient information, ranging from year 2021 to 2023.
### Step 1: Data Collection
* The dataset was gotten from YouTube.
### Step 2: Data Cleaning
* Imported the dataset into Power BI.
* Removed unwanted columns.
* Reviewed column data types for accuracy.
### Step3: Data Analysis
I made use of DAX for explicit measures to be used for the KPIs and that rest of the analysis. 
* I created measures to calculate the total number of patients, admission rate, admitted patients, average wait time, and average satisfaction.
* I created a table for age band for the purpose of proper sorting during data visualization.
* I also created a date table and connected it with the hospital data in the model view. 
### Step 4: Data Visualization
The visualization was done using Power BI. 
* The KPIs were created using the measures.
* An area chart was used to show the trend of number of patients throughout the year.
* I made use of bar charts to compare categories for total patients by race and total patients by departmental referral. 
* I used column charts to compare total patients by day and total patients by age band.
* I also made use of a donut chart to compare the total number of male patients with the total number of female patients.
* I added a slicer for years to filter information.
